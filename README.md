# Teaching-Ratings


Several researchers have examined the impact of how beauty affects labor market outcomes,particularly earnings, and have attempted to infer the sources of its effects from the behavior of different economic agents (Hamermesh and Biddle, 1994; Biddle and Hamermesh, 1998).

A substantial amount of research has indicated that academic administrators pay attention to teaching quality in setting salaries (Becker and Watts, 1999). A number of studies (e.g., Katz,1973; Siegfried and White, 1973; Kaun, 1984; Moore et al, 1998) have demonstrated thatteaching quality generates ceteris paribus increases in salary (but see DeLorme et al, 1979). The question is what generates the measured productivity for which the economic rewards are being offered. One possibility is simply that ascriptive characteristics, such as beauty, trigger positive responses by students and lead them to evaluate some teachers more favorably, so that theirbeauty earns them higher economic returns.

In this study, the productivity effects of beauty is examined in the context of undergraduate education and the impact of professors' looks on their instructional ratings (Working Paper 9853 http://www.nber.org/papers/w9853)

Dataset: The classes ranged in size from 8 to 581 students, while the number of students completing the instructional ratings ranged from 5 to 380. Underlying the 463 sample observations are 16,957 completed evaluations from 25,547 registered students
